## üöî **Project Overview**

Indian police forces handle 2200-3000 calls daily, with an average response time of over 32 minutes. This project addresses the critical need for faster and more accurate responses by leveraging real-time voice analysis and emotional prediction.

### **Key Objectives**
1. **Emotion Detection:** Analyze live call audio to determine:
   - Stressful Voice
   - Drunk Voice
   - Prank Voice
   - Abusive Voice
   - Painful Voice
   - Other mental states
2. **Dashboard Integration:** Provide responders with a user-friendly interface for accessing call analytics and caller details.

## üîß **Proposed Solution**

### **Features**
- **Dual Prognosis Model:** Employs two machine learning models to improve emotion detection accuracy.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Displays caller emotions, call types, and analytics with real-time updates.
- **Live Call Integration:** Ensures seamless handling of live emergency calls.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Audio Processing:** Mel spectrograms for feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
  - Bi-LSTM (Hindi + English)
  - Transformer Encoder
  - KNN Classifier
  - Logistic Regression
- **Tech Stack:**
  - React.js, Chart.js, Highcharts (Frontend)
  - Flask (Backend)
  - Twilio (Call Integration via REST APIs)
  - Stanza (NLP for regional dialects)
